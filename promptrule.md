# PROMPT RULES

> This file is a rulebook, not a per-service spec. `architecture-vX.md` tells the AI *what* to build for the current version; `services-index.md` tells it *what else exists*; this file tells it *how to behave regardless of what it's building*.
>
> Important: Amazon Q and Copilot chats don't automatically read files from your repo unless your IDE session has them open in a way the tool's context window picks up. Don't assume pasting `architecture-vX.md` and `services-index.md` is enough on its own — paste the relevant rules below into the prompt itself too (or at minimum the ones marked **[always paste]**), especially for fix prompts where scope discipline matters most.

---

## 1. Scope discipline — the most important section

- **[always paste]** Do not modify any file belonging to a different service. Every prompt targets exactly one service (or, for a fix prompt, exactly one file within one service). If a change genuinely requires touching two services, that will be stated explicitly as two separate prompts — never assume it's implied.
- **[always paste]** Only output the files explicitly listed in the prompt's "output every file in full" instruction (or, for a fix prompt, only the specific broken file). Do not regenerate, restate, or "helpfully" touch any file not named.
- Do not add endpoints, fields, DTOs, dependencies, or configuration beyond what's explicitly specified in the current prompt — even if it seems like an obvious or small addition. If something looks missing, flag it back to me in your response rather than adding it silently.
- Do not implement a feature from a later version ahead of schedule (e.g. don't add JWT while building v1's user-service just because "it's more secure" — v1's user-service is intentionally using a simple in-memory session, and that's a stated, deliberate choice, not an oversight to correct).
- **[always paste]** Every service's project (pom.xml, Spring Boot version, Spring Cloud version, all dependencies) is generated in advance via Spring Initializr, not by the AI. Never modify, add to, or remove anything from pom.xml, and never suggest a new dependency — if a dependency genuinely seems to be missing, say so and stop, don't add it yourself. Only write application code and configuration (`application.yml`, Java classes, templates) on top of the existing project structure.

## 2. Consistency rules

- Package names, class names, port numbers, and application.yml values must match exactly what's specified in the architecture file — do not rename anything for "clarity" or convention reasons.
- Once an enum-like status value (e.g. `Order.status` values `CART`, `PLACED`, `PENDING_PAYMENT`, `PAID`, `PAYMENT_FAILED`, `PAYMENT_PENDING_RETRY`) has been introduced in an earlier version, all of its existing values must be preserved when a later version adds new ones. Never drop or rename a previously-existing value while adding new ones — check `services-index.md` and the relevant earlier `architecture-vX.md` if unsure what already exists.
- Entity field names and types, once established, do not change in a later version unless that version's architecture file explicitly says so. If a later version needs a new field, it's additive, not a rename or a type change to an existing field.
- Follow whatever pattern an earlier service already established for equivalent situations (e.g. the `GlobalExceptionHandler` shape, the custom-exception-per-error-case pattern, the DTO-not-raw-entity response pattern) rather than inventing a new pattern for the same kind of problem.
- **Any entity field with a uniqueness constraint** (e.g. `@Column(unique = true)`) must be protected two ways, not one: (1) an explicit pre-save existence check (e.g. `existsByName`/`existsByEmail`) that throws a specific custom exception with a clear 409 message, AND (2) a catch of `DataIntegrityViolationException` in the same service's `GlobalExceptionHandler`, mapped to the same 409 status, as a backstop against race conditions where two requests pass the pre-check simultaneously. Never rely on the database exception alone — it produces an unreadable generic error unless caught explicitly, and never rely on the pre-check alone — it has a real (if narrow) race-condition gap under concurrent requests.

## 3. Resilience and error-handling boundaries

- Do not add retry logic, circuit breakers, timeouts, or fallback behavior on any inter-service call unless the current version's architecture file explicitly introduces it. Plain, unguarded calls are correct for early versions on purpose — resilience is deliberately deferred to v5, not an oversight to "fix" early.
- Do not add caching anywhere unless explicitly instructed. Recomputing from live calls is the deliberate v1–v4 default.
- Every new custom exception must be wired into that service's own `GlobalExceptionHandler` (or `WebExceptionHandler` for frontend-service) with a specific HTTP status — never let a business-logic error fall through to the generic 500 handler if a more specific one is called for.

## 4. Fix-prompt specific rules (Copilot error resolution)

- **[always paste]** When fixing an error, only the file(s) actually causing the error should be touched. Do not "clean up" or refactor adjacent working code while fixing an unrelated bug.
- Include the exact error message/stack trace, the specific broken file's current content, and nothing else from the rest of the codebase — do not paste the whole service's source as context for a fix unless the error genuinely can't be understood without it.
- If a fix requires understanding another service's contract (e.g. a deserialization mismatch with product-service's response shape), pull that contract from `services-index.md` or the relevant `architecture-vX.md`'s endpoint table — never paste the other service's actual source code as context for a fix in a different service.
- After a fix, re-run only the specific test case(s) from the version's testing checklist that relate to the broken behavior — don't treat every fix as a reason to re-test the entire service from scratch, unless the fix touched genuinely shared/core logic (e.g. the exception handler itself).

## 5. Testing gate rule

- **[always paste]** Do not consider a service "done" until every item in its version's testing checklist (in `architecture-vX.md`) passes. Do not begin the next service's construction prompt until the current one is marked `Built & Tested` in `services-index.md`.
- **[always paste]** If a test or manual check fails and you suspect the root cause lies in a *different* service than the one currently open, STOP. Do not open, inspect, or modify any other service's files, even speculatively "just to check." State clearly what you observed, why you suspect the other service, and what you'd want to verify there — then wait. The person will investigate and fix it themselves in that service's own chat, or explicitly tell you to proceed. This applies even if you are highly confident about the cause.
- If a test fails and the cause is confirmed to be within the current service, the fix belongs here — do not "fix" a failing order-service test by changing product-service's behavior unless the architecture file's contract for product-service was itself wrong (in which case, flag that explicitly rather than quietly patching around it).

## 6. Output style rules

- Prefer being told "the response was cut off after file X" over receiving a shortened or summarized version of a file — never truncate or abbreviate a file's content with a comment like "// rest of the code is similar." Full files only, every time.
- If a prompt's scope is genuinely too large for one response, say so explicitly and generate as much as fits cleanly (a complete file, not a partial one) rather than silently truncating mid-file.
